# Emotions_Analyzer_Affective_Symbolic_Structure_Mapper
Emotions
Analyzer, an interactive system that helps writers reflect on
their writing through a visualized emotional and symbolic
structure of a written piece. The system produces a multidimensional
radar chart based on seven metrics: symbolism,
spiritual metaphor, cognitive reflection, healing/acceptance, inner
dialogue, tone ambiguity, and emotional weight—allowing
writers to examine the emotional “route” of their text and assess
whether its intended affective qualities are effectively
communicated.
Unlike existing AI-based writing tools, which focus on correction
or linear textual analysis, the Emotions Analyzers provides
a form of ambient emotional visualization that supports the iterative,
spontaneous, and non-linear nature of creative writing. It aims to preserve writerly agency by enabling authors to
reflect on how their work may be interpreted without altering
their words or stylistic choices.
